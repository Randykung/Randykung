Obviously, it is called README, so you are reading me now. Also I made [that one Discord bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=972909603924869201&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) which is probably better than SophiaSan, STAR â˜† and 004 (Beta), idk.

You can talk to me at discord.gg/Vgg5m7wcDd.
